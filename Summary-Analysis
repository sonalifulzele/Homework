Summary Analysis for “PyCity Schools Analysis”

Based on the Summary Data, below are the few trends that I have observed
  1. The Overall Passing Rate for Charter schools is higher than any other school types.
  2. The spending per student increases as the Overall Passing rate goes down.
  3. The average scores across all the subjects and the overall passing rate is better when
    there are less students (school size is smaller). The more students or larger school size the scores go down.
